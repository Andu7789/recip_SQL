This is a quick version, made on the hob, with freshness coming from yoghurt instead of tomatoes. Serves 4.\n \nPrep time: 10 minutes\nCook time: 25 minutes\nIngredients:\n3 onions, peeled and finely sliced\n2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely sliced\n2 tbsp olive oil\n30g pine nuts \n2 tsp ground cumin\n½ tsp ground allspice\n400g lamb mince (20% fat)\n350g macaroni (or other small pasta shapes)\n1 litre whole milk\n100g unsalted butter\n60g feta, coarsely grated on a box grater\n120g halloumi, coarsely grated on a box grater\n120g red leicester, coarsely grated on a box grater\n100g natural yoghurt \nFine sea salt and black pepper\n \nMethod:\nPlace the onions, garlic, oil and ½ teaspoon of salt in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook for 20 minutes, until softened and dark brown. Add the pine nuts and cook for 1 minute until lightly golden, then add the cumin and allspice and cook for 30 seconds more, stirring constantly, until fragrant. Transfer half the onion mixture to a small bowl and add the lamb and ½ teaspoon salt to the pan. Use a spatula to break up the meat, then fry, stirring occasionally, until the meat has browned, 8-10 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, add the pasta, milk, butter and ¾ teaspoon salt to a large saucepan on a medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring regularly to prevent the pasta sticking to the bottom of the pan. Once boiling, cook for 7 minutes (or two minutes less than your packet instructions), until the liquid has mostly reduced, there should be about 3 cm of liquid in the bottom of the pan, then take off the heat. Stir through the cheese and a good grind of pepper, and leave to sit for a minute. The pasta sauce should be nicely coating the pasta, if too thin, return to the heat for one minute more.\n\nTo serve, transfer the pasta to a large shallow serving bowl and top with the lamb, then drizzle over the yoghurt and the reserved onions.","_id":"pYZSzTFyIBX47Vqa"}
