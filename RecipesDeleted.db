Lay the paper over the surface of the vegetables, sealing them in right to the edges of the pan (this helps cook the vegetables more quickly). Put a lid on the pan, cook on a low heat for 8-10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and the onions are soft and translucent.\n\nRemove the paper. Add the peas and stock to the pan, then bring to the boil. Cook for a couple of minutes, or until all of the peas have floated to the top and are tender and bright.\n\nTake the pan off the heat. Using a stick blender, process the peas until very smooth. Add the milk (or, if preferred, use more stock, water or cream). Tear in most of the ham. Bring the soup back to a simmer, then season to taste with salt and pepper, remembering that the ham is fairly salty.\n\nTo serve, ladle the soup into bowls then scatter with the rest of the ham and a few torn mint leaves.","_id":"l7QHEqQrdwnlh1kw"}
